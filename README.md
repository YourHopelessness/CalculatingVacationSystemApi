# CalculatingVacationSystem

This project is for calculating employee vacations (according to the laws of the russian federation). 

The calculation is carried out for the following types of vacations:
* Annual paid vacation
* Extraordinary paid vacation
* Extraordinary unpaid leave

It also takes into account the possibility that the employee has special rights and privileges that affect the duration of the vacation and whether approval is required.
